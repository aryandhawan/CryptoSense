# CryptoSense
CryptoSense is an AI-powered cryptocurrency market predictor that uses machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to analyze past trends and predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies.

🔍 Features:
✅ Fetches real-time crypto market data using CoinGecko API
✅ Predicts market trends using 6 months of historical data
✅ Provides market capitalization and 24-hour price change
✅ Uses Random Forest Classifier for AI-driven predictions

🛠 How It Works
1️⃣ The script fetches real-time and historical crypto data from CoinGecko.
2️⃣ It trains a machine learning model using the past 6 months of data.
3️⃣ The model predicts whether the crypto price will increase or decrease in the coming days.
4️⃣ Users can choose whether to see market trends only or get AI-powered predictions.

🎨 Looking for a GUI Developer!
🔥 We want to make CryptoSense even better by adding a GUI (Graphical User Interface). If you're skilled in:

✅ Tkinter / PyQt / Electron.js / React.js
✅ Integrating ML models into GUI applications

👉 We’d love your help! Drop a message or open a GitHub issue if you're interested!

💡 Future Enhancements
✔️ Build an interactive CryptoSense Dashboard
✔️ Improve AI predictions using LSTMs & deep learning
✔️ Add support for multiple cryptocurrencies
